Find a path between the pixels

Description :
You are given an array matrix of pixels having values ‚Äò0‚Äô and ‚Äò1‚Äô. 
Write a program to identify if there exists a path between the 
coordinates (0,0) and (x,y) in the matrix, given the condition that
you can move only along the ‚Äò1‚Äôs. If there is a path between (0,0) and 
the given coordinates then print ‚Äú path found‚Äù else print ‚Äú path not found‚Äù.

Constraints : Use a stack for your solution

Input: The codeshould take the five lines of input from the users :
üåü The first line should be the number of rows in the input pixel matrix.
üåü The next line should be the number of columns in the pixel matrix.
üåü The third line should be the elements of the matrix.
üåü Next take the x-coordinate of the pixel to which the path is to be found as input.
üåü The y-coordinate of the pixel matrix to which the path is to be found.

Note: 
Input matrix should consist of elements 1 and 0.

Output: Only one line of output which will display "path found" if there exists a path between the given coordinates of the matrix, else "path not found" will be shown.

Sample Test case:
Input :
4
4
1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 1 1 1
3
3

Output :
path found

Explanation:
There will 4 rows and 4 columns according to the first two lines of input. 
Next input is a 4*4 matrix of pixel values and then the x and y coordinates of the destination are given. 
The code needs to find if there exists a path between (0,0) and (3,3).

Input :
4

output :
